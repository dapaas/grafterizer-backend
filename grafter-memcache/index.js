/**
 * Grafter-memcache is a server component.
 * It sits between Graftwerk and the client to save Graftwerk
 * requests in memory, and also to prevent HTTP timeouts.
 *
 * It takes the Graftwerk query as input, computes a hash and
 * transfer the query to Graftwerk. The client receives a ticket
 * and can fetch the result in a separate query. If the result is
 * not ready after a specified delay, the client is asked to try
 * again. We chosed this behavior in order to prevent HTTP timeouts
 * that can be triggered by many components (CDNs, browser, proxy…).
 *
 * It's a NodeJS software (tested with NodeJS 4.0.0)
 * Some parts are developed using JavaScript ES6.
